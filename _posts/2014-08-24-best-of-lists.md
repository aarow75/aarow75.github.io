I'm a fan of lists, and particularly "Best of" lists. For things I'm unfamiliar with, they serve as a way to introduce me to the highlights of a particular thing, whether it's a list of books in a certain genre, great music, or whatever. For things I am familiar with, it's something to reflect on as a "do I agree with this" or a way to group some things that go great together. I've always been a fan of music, however, my tastes aren't particularly mainstream (with plenty of exceptions though). My best of music lists will be quite limited since I don't listen to much popular music.

Some lists I'll make will be:

- Best Depeche Mode albums
- Best albums of 1995
- Best Batman story
- Best Edgar Rice Burroughs series

Some of these I may revisit from time to time and update. All of these lists are completely subjective, but I will at least try to justify my choices with things that are a little more objective.
